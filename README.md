# Applying Python in a Text Adventure game
Important Note: Code is in one file because of the limitation of Codecademy Labs!

After almost finishing a Python course on Udemy, I decided to create a game to apply my newly gained knowledge through a medium that I love. I'm not one to simply know how to use it after watching tutorials and taking notes.

So here it is, my attempt to make a text rpg adventure game. The idea, thus far, is to create a world that the user (the "player") can move around in and interact with their surroundings. The goals are to keep motivated and create a fully-functioning text adventure.

Background: There's a folder called "dct old version." I began creating this game using dictionaries for everything because I was intimidated by using OOP. 11 days into creation, I added the feature of "doors" to the "rooms" and broke the 'object converter' I had created (to make my separate objects dictionary work with my rooms dictionary). Several hours passed, and I made the hard decision to start over, using classes instead of dictionaries. Obviously, I still use dictionaries in my code, but all my items, objects, and rooms have been created through classes. I've kept the folder because my current version isn't up-to-date with it so I have it as a reference. May or may not remove it once I've passed its condition.

Limitations: time (if you don't have time, you MAKE time), personal understanding of language

Pondering Issue: Properly dealing with errors and exceptions to avoid breaks.
